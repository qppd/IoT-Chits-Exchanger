# IoT Chits Exchanger

## Overview
The IoT Chits Exchanger is a smart system designed to automate the process of exchanging coins and bills for chits. This system is built using an ESP32 microcontroller and integrates various peripherals to provide a seamless user experience. The system is ideal for applications such as vending machines, ticket dispensers, and other automated kiosks.

## Features
- **Coin Slot**: Detects coin insertion using interrupt-based pulse detection with debounce logic.
- **Bill Acceptor**: Handles bill insertion with debounce logic to ensure accurate detection.
- **Servo Dispenser**: Dispenses chits using a servo motor controlled by the PCA9685 driver.
- **I2C LCD Display**: A 20x4 LCD screen displays messages and instructions to the user.
- **Tactile Buttons**: Provides user input options with debounce logic for reliability.
- **Modular Design**: Each component is modular, making it easy to test and replace.

## Hardware Components
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: The brain of the system, responsible for controlling all peripherals.
- **Coin Slot**: Detects and processes coin inputs.
- **Bill Acceptor**: Detects and processes bill inputs.
- **Servo Motor**: Dispenses chits.
- **PCA9685 Driver**: Controls the servo motor.
- **20x4 I2C LCD**: Displays messages and instructions.
- **Tactile Buttons**: Allows user interaction.
- **Power Supply**: Provides power to all components.

## Software Components
- **Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)**: Handle real-time events like coin and bill insertion.
- **Debounce Logic**: Ensures reliable detection of user inputs.
- **LCD Control**: Manages the display of messages on the LCD screen.
- **Servo Control**: Handles the movement of the servo motor for chit dispensing.
- **Pin Configuration**: Centralized file for managing pin assignments.
